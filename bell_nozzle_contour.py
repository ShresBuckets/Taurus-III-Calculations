To calculate the bell nozzle spline, the following inputs are needed:
- throat radius 
- expansion ratio (calculated)
- Length of a conical nozzle with 80% half angle and same expansion ratio/throat radius (contained in calculations.py)

(the next two are derived from a graph shown in Huzel/Huang):
- initial diverging half angle
- exit diverging half angle
