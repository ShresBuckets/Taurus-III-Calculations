Taurus 3 Calculations and Data Visualizations

How to use this program to find nozzle dimensions:
1. Perform a parameteric sweep on PROPEP over a range of OF ratios at differing chamber pressures. Collect resulting data in a spreadsheet and calculate the ISP at each parameter (do not record the value of ISP* as this is the vacuum optimized ISP, a subtly different metric). 

2. Determine the impulse and burn time from requirements.

3. Import PROPEP data and ISP as a CSV. Change hardcoded values for impulse and burn time.
